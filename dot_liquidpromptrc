# LP_MARK_PREFIX: String added directly before LP_MARK_DEFAULT, after all other parts of the prompt. Can be used to tag the prompt in a way that is less intrusive than LP_PS1_PREFIX, or add a newline before the prompt mark. For example:
# LP_MARK_PREFIX=$'\n'
#
# Default: " "
LP_MARK_PREFIX=" "

# LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP: The number of characters to save at the start and possibly the end of a directory name when shortening the path. See LP_PATH_METHOD for details of the specific methods.
# New in version 2.0.
# Default: 3
LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP=3

# LP_PATH_KEEP: The number of directories (counting ‘/’) to display at the beginning of a shortened path.
# Set to 1, will display only root. Set to 0, will keep nothing from the beginning of the path.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
# See also: LP_PATH_LENGTH and LP_PATH_METHOD.
# Changed in version 2.0: No longer supports a value of -1.
# Default: 2
LP_PATH_KEEP=2

# LP_PATH_LENGTH: The maximum percentage of the terminal width used to display the path before removing the center portion of the path and replacing with LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
# Note
# LP_PATH_KEEP and LP_PATH_METHOD have higher precedence over this option. Important path parts, including directories saved by LP_PATH_KEEP, LP_PATH_VCS_ROOT, and the last directory, will always be displayed, even if the path does not fit in the maximum length.
# Default: 35
LP_PATH_LENGTH=35

# LP_PATH_METHOD: Sets the method used for shortening the path display when it exceeds the maximum length set by LP_PATH_LENGTH.
# truncate_chars_from_path_left: Truncates characters from the start of the path, showing consecutive directories as one shortened section. E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Liquidprompt/tests, it will be shortened to ...prompt/tests. The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
# truncate_chars_from_dir_right: Leaves the beginning of a directory name untouched. E.g. directories will be shortened like so: ~/Doc.../Office. How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP. The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
# truncate_chars_from_dir_middle: Leaves the beginning and end of a directory name untouched. E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Office, then it will be shortened to ~/MyS...cts/Office. How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP. The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
# truncate_chars_to_unique_dir: Truncate each directory to the shortest unique starting portion of their name. E.g. in a folder ~/dev/liquidprompt, it will be shortened to ~/d/liquidprompt if there is no other directory starting with ‘d’ in the home directory.
# truncate_to_last_dir: Only display the last directory in the path. In other words, the current directory name.
# All methods (other than ‘truncate_to_last_dir’) start at the far left of the path (limited by LP_PATH_KEEP). Only the minimum number of directories needed to fit inside LP_PATH_LENGTH will be shortened.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
# New in version 2.0.
# Default: "truncate_chars_from_path_left"
LP_PATH_METHOD="truncate_chars_from_path_left"

# LP_PATH_VCS_ROOT: Display the root directory of the current VCS repository with special formatting, set by LP_COLOR_PATH_VCS_ROOT. If LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH is enabled, also prevent the path shortening from shortening or hiding the VCS root directory.
# New in version 2.0.
# Default: 1

# LP_DELIMITER_KUBECONTEXT_PREFIX: Delimiter to shorten the Kubernetes context by removing a prefix.
# Usage example:
# if your context names are cluster-dev and cluster-test, then set this to “-” in order to output “dev” and “test” in prompt.
# if using AWS EKS then set this to ‘/’ to show only the cluster name, without the rest of the ARN (arn:aws:eks:$AWS_REGION:$ACCOUNT_ID:cluster/$CLUSTER_NAME)
# alternatively, if using AWS EKS, set this to ‘:’ to show only “cluster/$CLUSTER_NAME”. (Note: the prefix removed is a greedy match - it contains all the “:”s in the input.)
# If set to the empty string no truncating will occur (this is the default).
# See also: LP_ENABLE_KUBECONTEXT, LP_DELIMITER_KUBECONTEXT_SUFFIX, LP_COLOR_KUBECONTEXT, and LP_MARK_KUBECONTEXT.
# New in version 2.1.
# Default: ""
LP_DELIMITER_KUBECONTEXT_PREFIX="/EchoboxEKS-"

# LP_DELIMITER_KUBECONTEXT_SUFFIX: Delimiter to shorten the Kubernetes context by removing a suffix.

# if your context names are dev.k8s.example.com and test.k8s.example.com, then set this to “.” in order to output “dev” and “test” in prompt. (Note: the suffix removed is a greedy match - it contains all the “.”s in the input.)

# LP_DISABLED_VCS_PATHS: An array of absolute directory paths where VCS features will be disabled. Generally this would be used for repositories that are large and slow, where generating VCS information for the prompt would impact prompt responsiveness.
# Any subdirectory under the input directory is also disabled, so setting “/repos” would disable VCS display when the current directory is “/repos/a-repo”. Setting ("/") would disable VCS display completely.
# An example value would be:
# LP_DISABLED_VCS_PATHS=("/a/svn/repo" "/home/me/my/large/repo")

# LP_ENABLE_CONTAINER: Indicate if the shell is running in a container environment (e.g. Docker, Podman, LXC, Singularity, systemd-nspawn).
# Note
# Containers may inherit some or even no variables from their parent shell, so this may behave inconsisently with different container software. For example, Docker doesn’t inherit anything unless explicitly told to. Singularity in many configurations inherits most variables but shell functions and zsh hooks might not make it in. For full functionality, liquidprompt may need to be sourced inside the child container.
